# BBEditTileHorizontally
Script to tile windows horizontally in BBEdit even with dual monitors


## Installation

Clone or download this repository. The script files must be installed in the same location. Either  ~Library/Scripts/Applications/BBEdit or ~Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Scripts/ make sense. 

If you would like to remove the prompt for the number of monitors, edit the first few lines of the applescript and save the changes.

## History

[BBEdit currently does not work with SplitView](https://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/faqs.html#splitview) and the build-in Arrange -> Tile Horizontally command does not work with dual monitors. So I came up with the following to fix the problem. 

## Credits

Much credit due to various posts on StackOverflow, Perl Mavens for refreshing some syntax, and other Applescript resources around the web.

## License

Yours to do what you want with.
